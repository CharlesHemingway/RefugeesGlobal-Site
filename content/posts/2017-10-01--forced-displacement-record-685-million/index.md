Globally, the forcibly displaced population increased in 2017 by 2.9 million. By the end of the year, 68.5 million individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide as a result of persecution, conflict, or generalized violence.

**Crisis Overview:**
* 25.4 million refugees
* 19.9 million refugees under UNHCR’s mandate
* 5.4 million Palestine refugees under UNRWA’s mandate
* 40.0 million internally displaced people
* 3.1 million asylum-seekers

Refugees who have fled their countries to escape conflict and persution accounted for 25.4 million. This is 2.9 million more than in 2016, also the biggest increase ever recorded in a single year.New displacement is set to grow as at least 16.2 million people were displaced during 2017 either for the first time or repeatedly. That is an average of one person displaced every two seconds mostly with mostly resource rich but under developed countries being the most affected.

Leading the displacement during the year was the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the war in South Sudan and the escape into Bangladesh from Myanmar of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees escaping genocide and prosecution. The number of asylum-seekers awaiting the outcome of their applications for refugee status had risen by about 300,000, to 3.1 million, by the end of December 2017. People displaced inside their own country accounted for 40 million of the total, slightly fewer than the 40.3 million in 2016.

_“We are at a watershed, where success in managing forced displacement globally requires a new and far more comprehensive approach so that countries and communities aren’t left dealing with this alone,” UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said._

Almost two-thirds of those forced to flee are internally displaced people who have not left their own countries. Of the 25.4 million refugees, just over a fifth are Palestinians, two-thirds come from just five countries: Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar and Somalia. An end to conflict & genocide in any one of these has potential to significantly influence the wider global displacement picture.
